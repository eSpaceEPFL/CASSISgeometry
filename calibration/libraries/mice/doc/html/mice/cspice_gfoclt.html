<PRE>
</pre><h4><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h4><pre>

   CSPICE_GFOCLT determines time intervals when an observer sees one target
   body occulted by, or in transit across, another.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      Parameters-

      All parameters described here are declared in the header file
      SpiceGF.h. See that file for parameter values.

      SPICE_GF_CNVTOL

               is the convergence tolerance used for finding endpoints of
               the intervals comprising the result window.
               SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is used to determine when binary searches
               for roots should terminate: when a root is bracketed
               within an interval of length SPICE_GF_CNVTOL, the root is
               considered to have been found.

               The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found
               by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input
               data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
               inferior to their precision.

      Arguments-

      occtyp   the string naming the type of occultation to find.
               Note that transits are considered to be a type of
               occultation.

               Supported values and corresponding definitions are:

                  'FULL'               denotes the full occultation
                                       of the body designated by
                                       'back' by the body designated
                                       by 'front', as seen from
                                       the location of the observer.
                                       In other words, the occulted
                                       body is completely invisible
                                       as seen from the observer's
                                       location.

                  'ANNULAR'            denotes an annular
                                       occultation: the body
                                       designated by 'front' blocks
                                       part of, but not the limb of,
                                       the body designated by 'back',
                                       as seen from the location of
                                       the observer.

                  'PARTIAL'            denotes a partial,
                                       non-annular occultation: the
                                       body designated by 'front'
                                       blocks part, but not all, of
                                       the limb of the body
                                       designated by 'back', as seen
                                       from the location of the
                                       observer.

                  'ANY'                denotes any of the above three
                                       types of occultations:
                                       'PARTIAL', 'ANNULAR', or
                                       'FULL'.

                                       'ANY' should be used to search
                                       for times when the body
                                       designated by 'front' blocks
                                       any part of the body designated
                                       by 'back'.

                                       The option 'ANY' must be used
                                       if either the front or back
                                       target body is modeled as
                                       a point.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in
               the string 'occtyp'.

               [1,c1] = size(occtyp), char = class(occtyp)

      front    the string naming the target body that occults---that
               is, passes in front of---the other. Optionally, you may
               supply the integer NAIF ID code for the body as a
               string. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
               legitimate strings that designate the Moon.

               The 'front' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

               [1,c2] = size(front), char = class(front)

      fshape   the string naming the geometric model used
               to represent the shape of the front target body. The
               supported options are:

                 'ELLIPSOID'     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model
                                 with radius values provided from the
                                 kernel pool. A kernel variable
                                 having a name of the form

                                    'BODYnnn_RADII'

                                 where nnn represents the NAIF
                                 integer code associated with the
                                 body, must be present in the kernel
                                 pool. This variable must be
                                 associated with three numeric
                                 values giving the lengths of the
                                 ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.

                 'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point.
                                 When a point target is specified,
                                 the occultation type must be
                                 set to 'ANY'.

               At least one of the target bodies 'front' and 'back' must
               be modeled as an ellipsoid.

               The 'fshape' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

               [1,c3] = size(fshape), char = class(fshape)

      fframe   the string naming the body-fixed, body-centered reference
               frame associated with the front target body. Examples
               of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and
               'ITRF93' (for the Earth).

               If the front target body is modeled as a point, 'fframe'
               should be left empty or blank.

               The 'fframe' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

               [1,c4] = size(fframe), char = class(fframe)

      back     the string naming the target body that is occulted
               by---that is, passes in back of---the other.
               Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code
               for the body as a string. For example both 'MOON' and
               '301' are legitimate strings that designate the Moon.

               The 'back' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

               [1,c5] = size(back), char = class(back)

      bshape   the string naming the shape specification for the body
               designated by 'back'. The supported options are those for
                'fshape'. See the description of 'fshape' above for
                details.

               [1,c6] = size(bshape), char = class(bshape)

      bframe   the string naming the body-fixed, body-centered
               reference frame associated with the ''back'' target body.
               Examples of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn)
               and 'ITRF93' (for the Earth).

               If the back target body is modeled as a point, 'bframe'
               should be left empty or blank.

               The 'bframe' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading
               and trailing blanks.

               [1,c7] = size(bframe), char = class(bframe)

      abcorr   the string indicating the aberration corrections to to apply
               to the state of the target body to account for one-way
               light time.  Stellar aberration corrections are
               ignored if specified, since these corrections don't
               improve the accuracy of the occultation determination.

               This routine accepts the same aberration corrections as does
               the CSPICE routine <a href="../cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>. See the header of spkezr_c for a
               detailed description of the aberration correction options.
               For convenience, the options are listed below:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction.

                  'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'LT+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'CN+S'     &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

                  'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

               The 'abcorr' string lacks sensitivity to case, and to embedded,
               leading and trailing blanks.

               [1,c8] = size(abcorr), char = class(abcorr)

      obsrvr   the scalar naming the observing body. Optionally, you
               may supply the ID code of the object as an integer string.
               For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate
               strings to supply to indicate the observer is Earth.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in
               the string 'obsrvr'.

               [1,c9] = size(obsrvr), char = class(obsrvr)

      step     the step size to use in the search. 'step' must be shorter
               than any interval, within the confinement window, over which
               the specified occultation condition is met. In other words,
               'step' must be shorter than the shortest occultation event
               the user wishes to detect; 'step' must also be shorter than
               the shortest time interval between two occultation events that
               occur within the confinement window (see below). However,
               'step' must not be *too* short, or the search will take
               an unreasonable amount of time.

               The choice of 'step' affects the completeness but not
               the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
               precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
               See the discussion of the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL for
               details.

               'step' has units of TDB seconds.

               [1,1] = size(step), double = class(step)

      cnfine   the SPICE window that confines the time
               period over which the specified search is conducted.
               'cnfine' may consist of a single interval or a collection
               of intervals.

               In some cases the confinement window can be used to
               greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
               for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
               below for further discussion.

               [2m,1] = size(cnfine), double = class(cnfine)

      room     the maximum number of intervals to return in 'result'.
               Note: this value should equal at least the number of expected
               intervals. Recall two double precision values define
               an interval.

               [1,1] = size(room), int32 = class(room)

   the call:

      result = <b>cspice_gfoclt</b>( occtyp, front,  fshape, fframe, ...
                              back,   bshape, bframe, abcorr, ...
                              obsrvr, step,   cnfine, room)

   returns:

      result   the SPICE window of intervals, contained within the
               confinement window 'cnfine', on which the specified
               constraint is satisfied.

               If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
               constraint, 'result' will return with cardinality zero.

               [2n,1] = size(result), double = class(result)

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   Example(1):

      Find occultations of the Sun by the Moon (that is, solar
      eclipses)as seen from the center of the Earth over the month
      December, 2001.

</pre><h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4><pre>

   This routine provides a simple interface for conducting searches for
   occultation events.

   This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
   within the confinement window when a specified type of
   occultation occurs. The resulting set of intervals is returned as
   a SPICE window.

   Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
   solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
   use of this routine in user applications.

   The Search Process
   ==================

   The search for occultations is treated as a search for state
   transitions: times are sought when the state of the `back' body
   changes from &quot;not occulted&quot; to &quot;occulted&quot; or vice versa.

   Step Size
   =========

   Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows:
   first, the input step size is used to determine the time
   separation at which the occultation state will be sampled.
   Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be
   taken at each step. If a state change is detected, a root has
   been bracketed; at that point, the &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the
   state change occurs---is found by a refinement process, for
   example, by a binary search.

   Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
   of the intervals over which the occultation state is constant:
   the step size should be shorter than the shortest occultation
   duration and the shortest period between occultations, within
   the confinement window.

   Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and
   observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
   In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
   picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
   time.

   Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
   the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
   That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.

   Convergence Tolerance
   =====================

   As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine
   involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process
   to locate them. &quot;Roots&quot; are both times when local extrema are
   attained and times when the distance function is equal to a
   reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the
   result window are either endpoints of intervals of the
   confinement window or roots.

   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
   narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
   This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
   has been determined to within an error margin called the
   &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The convergence tolerance used by this
   routine is set by the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL.

   The value of SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
   tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of
   solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input
   data will be the limiting factor.

   The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a>, e.g.

      <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a>( tolerance value in seconds )

   Call <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
   searches will use the updated tolerance value.

   Setting the tolerance tighter than SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is unlikely to be
   useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
   Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
   since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
   cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater affect on
   processing time than would the convergence tolerance.

   The Confinement Window
   ======================

   The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
   interval within which a solution is sought. However, the
   confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches
   more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
   to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
   slow search of interest must be performed.

      Renamed the argument 'size' to 'room'. &quot;size&quot; is a Matlab function
      name and it's seriously dumb to use a function name word as an argument
      name.

      Edited I/O section to conform to NAIF standard for Mice documentation.

      Header updated to describe use of <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a>.
