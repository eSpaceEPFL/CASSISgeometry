# Starfield calibration
Repository contains code for geometric calibration of CaSSIS using starfield data

## Prerequisits
Before using this code you need to preinstall:
1. Matlab 2015b 
2. [MICE library](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html "MICE library") 
3. [Astrometry library](http://astrometry.net/use.html "Astrometry library")

The calibration procedure is described in "Technical Report: Geometric calibration of CaSSIS using star-field images" and updates that you can find in doc folder.

## Process
To start calibration run PIPELINE script.
